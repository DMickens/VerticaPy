# Vertica-ML-Python allows user to create Virtual Dataframe. vDataframes simplify   #
# data exploration,   data cleaning   and   machine   learning   in    Vertica.     #
# It is an object which keeps in it all the actions that the user wants to achieve  # 
# and execute them when they are needed.    										#
#																					#
# The purpose is to bring the logic to the data and not the opposite                #

	long_description = "The 'Big Data' (Tb of data) is now one of the main topics in the Data Science World. Data Scientists are now very important for any organisation. Becoming Data-Driven is mandatory to survive. Vertica is the first real analytic columnar Database and is still the fastest in the market. However, SQL is not enough flexible to be very popular for Data Scientists. Python flexibility is priceless and provides to any user a very nice experience. The level of abstraction is so high that it is enough to think about a function to notice that it already exists. Many Data Science APIs were created during the last 15 years and were directly adopted by the Data Science community (examples: pandas and scikit-learn). However, Python is only working in-memory for a single node process. Even if some famous highly distributed programming languages exist to face this challenge, they are still in-memory and most of the time they can not process on all the data. Besides, moving the data can become very expensive. Data Scientists must also find a way to deploy their data preparation and their models. We are far away from easiness and the entire process can become time expensive. \nThe idea behind VERTICA ML PYTHON is simple: Combining the Scalability of VERTICA with the Flexibility of Python to give to the community what they need *Bringing the logic to the data and not the opposite*. \nVertica-ML-Python is a Python library that exposes sci-kit like functionality to conduct data science projects on data stored in Vertica, thus taking advantage Vertica’s speed and built-in analytics and machine learning capabilities. It supports the entire data science life cycle, uses a ‘pipeline’ mechanism to sequentialize data transformation operation (called Virtual Dataframe), and offers multiple graphical rendering possibilities.",
