Vertica-ML-Python is a Python library that exposes sci-kit like functionality to conduct data science projects on data stored in Vertica, thus taking advantage Vertica’s speed and built-in analytics and machine learning capabilities. It supports the entire data science life cycle, uses a ‘pipeline’ mechanism to sequentialize data transformation operation (called Virtual Dataframe), and offers multiple graphical rendering possibilities.
